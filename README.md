Welcome to our hotel database system project. This is for the CSS325 Database Systems project this semester.
This is our first time using the Github repository as well

The objective of this project is to:
- Apply our knowledge we learned from class to a real-world scenario
- Understand the functions and needs of hotel systems


Our hotel database system consists of both the guest and staff side. For the staff side, we only focus on
the Manager and Receptionist of the hotel.
